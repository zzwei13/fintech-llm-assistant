The company has shown resilience in its financials, with increasing book value per share and relatively stable capital over the past 5 years. Although the ROE and ROA have been volatile, the recent recovery in EPS and the stable debt-to-asset ratio suggest potential for growth. The industry's demand for electrical wires and cables is expected to increase due to the growing need for renewable energy and technological advancements. Additionally, the company's diversified business segments, including engineering design and technical services, provide a stable source of revenue. The current price is relatively low compared to its historical high, and the P/E ratio is reasonable, indicating potential for a price increase.
